# Arduino Reaction Game

A small reaction-time game I built using:
- Arduino UNO
- I2C LCD (16x2)
- Two push buttons
- Red + Green LEDs
- Buzzer

## How it works
The game has 3 rounds.  
Both players wait for the LED to turn green.  
If someone presses early, the other player gets the point.  
Times are shown on the LCD, and final results appear at the end, although the winner is already decided after the end of second round :p.

## Features
- Cheat detection
- Round-based scoring
- LED and buzzer feedback
