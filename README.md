# Arduino Reaction Game

A small reaction-time game built using an Arduino UNO, two buttons, two LEDs, a buzzer, and a 16x2 I2C LCD.

Players wait for the LED to turn green and press their button as fast as possible. Pressing early counts as a cheat and gives a point to the other player. The game runs for three rounds and shows the final winner at the end, although the winner is already decided after the end of second round :p.
